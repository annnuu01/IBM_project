IBM SkillsBuild 4-Week Internship on AI & Cloud Technologies:
in this internship i learnt about machine learning AI and cloud technologies.I did courses on ibm skillbuild platform about Ai and cloud technologies also i made a machine learning project using ibm cloud.
Problem statement: The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is a major rural development program with various schemes like PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, etc. Manually classifying thousands of projects under these schemes is slow, error-prone, and unscalable. This inefficiency hinders effective monitoring, budget allocation, and impact assessment.
solution: To automate the classification of PMGSY infrastructure projects, a machine learning model was developed and deployed using IBM Cloud. The model uses a multiclass classification approach to categorize projects into schemes like PMGSY-I and PMGSY-II. Project data is preprocessed through techniques such as text cleaning and vectorization (TF-IDF), then used to train classification algorithms like Logistic Regression or SVM. The best-performing model is deployed using IBM Watson Studio and IBM Watson Machine Learning, with data stored in IBM Cloud Object Storage. This cloud-based setup ensures the solution is scalable, easily accessible, and integrates seamlessly into rural project monitoring systems.
